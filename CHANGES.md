# Changes for next release

- New: Flavors

Flavors are an extension to export configs which let you explicitly define how you can overwrite translations. Export configs are now soley there to define the format of your exported translations and don't automatically allow to override translations. You can now export your overwritten translations in multiple formats.

- New: Tags filter

This allows to filter keys based on tags on the keys and editor site.
